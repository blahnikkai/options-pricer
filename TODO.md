- Idk if the perfect hedging calculation still works for American options
- Print what you are calculating in cli
- Find different example values that have a different price for American calls than European
- Unify cli and test values?
- Consider reordering cli options and args to pricing functions into market (risk free rate), underlying, and options contract itself (strike, time to expiry)
